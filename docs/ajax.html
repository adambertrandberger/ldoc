You can also separate your HTML in to a separate file and have ldoc load the HTML via an AJAX request. To be able to do this, you must host your ldoc document on a web server (due to security issues).
</p>

<p>
    You can specify a page to be loaded via AJAX by not giving ldoc any HTML when calling <code>ldoc.page</code>. ldoc will expect there to be an HTML file with the same name as the page's hash "url". For example:
</p>

<pre>
    <code>
ldoc.page('Meatball Stew', 'meatball-stew');
    </code>
</pre>

<p>
    In this example, there needs to be a file called <code>meatball-stew.html</code> in the same directory as your document's HTML file. ldoc will automatically load this as soon as the user loads the page.
